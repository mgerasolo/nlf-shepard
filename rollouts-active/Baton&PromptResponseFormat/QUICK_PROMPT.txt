## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR PROJECT UPDATES ##

I need to update this project with the latest standardized response format and baton context management system.

Please follow these steps:

1. Read the standardized response format from:
   /home/mgerasolo/Dev/self-improving-ai/skeleton_template/CLAUDE.md.template

2. Read the baton skill from:
   /home/mgerasolo/Dev/self-improving-ai/skeleton_template/.claude-code/skills/baton/SKILL.md

3. Update this project's CLAUDE.md to include:
   - Standardized Response Format section (with bullet list format requirement)
   - Context Management Protocol section (baton system)
   - Keep all existing project-specific content

4. Copy the baton skill to this project:
   - Target: .claude-code/skills/baton/SKILL.md

5. Initialize baton directory structure:
   - Create .claude/ directory with CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md, BUGS.md, DECISIONS.md
   - Create .claude/conversations/ directory

6. Verify the format works by responding to this message using the standardized format

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- All sections MUST use bullet list format (dash prefix) for proper line break rendering
- Example: "- [Conversation title]" NOT "[Conversation title]"
- This is a CommonMark markdown requirement

Reference project: /home/mgerasolo/Dev/self-improving-ai/

After completion, test that:
- Line breaks render properly in your response
- /baton commands are available
- Format includes all 8 sections (Title, Request, Tasks, Summary, Next, Required Tasks, USER ACTION NEEDED, Additional Notes, Context)
